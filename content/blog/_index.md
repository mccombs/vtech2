Like any tech-based business we work on many problems unique to our shop.  We
have our own ways of organizing work, approaching problems, designing
architecture, implementing code, and maintaining infrastructure.

We draw heavily on our past experience in product development, and borrow just
as heavily from external ideas that we discover along the way. We believe that
"not-invented-here" is a uselessly incurious mindset.

We're experts in building teams and slinging code. Our team is small,
high-powered, tight-knit, and colocated in Austin, Texas, in an office full of
freewheeling communication and challenge.

We have a hard time finding developers who can keep up with us. Their senior
is our junior.

Do you want to join us? Try out some of the questions we post here in the blog
based on what we encounter in our work. Broad and deep skills and strong
desire to learn are essential. Answer some of the questions and show us your
strengths.
