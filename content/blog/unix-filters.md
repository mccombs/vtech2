What is a unix filter?

A unix filter is a program that reads data from standard input, writes data to
standard output, and logs to standard error. (Some definitions do not include
logging to standard error --- YMMV.) Anyone who has spent time on the command
line in a terminal has worked with unix filters.

What makes the unix filter a powerful concept for processing data?

What cool things have you done with unix filters?

How can you turn any unix filter into a network server?
