Vertalo is growing and hiring in Austin! The successful recruit will work hand
in glove with the CTO and a highly skilled technical team. The upside
potential is extremely large for the right candidate in terms of both cash
compensation and equity. This is no mere job. It requires a founder's caring
and curious mentality, and a burning desire to ship code to shape the future
of finance.

Our mission is to **connect and enable the digital asset ecosystem**. Our
product is the Vertalo platform, a data management system for digital assets.
It lets our clients create liquidity for their assets and investors. Think of
a traditional cap table reimagined for the emerging digital asset sector
(meaning soon, all private assets).

Our focus on digital assets and secondary liquidity sets us apart from larger
incumbents, while our expertise in technology and regulations sets us apart
from other newcomers. All this equates to a huge market and huge growth
potential for our team, with extensive near-term opportunities and longer-term
exit scenarios for the company.

We sling lots of code and iterate fast. Check out some of our
[questions]({{< relref "/tags/question" >}}) to see how we think.

*These are not remote positions. You will be required to work out of our
offices here in Austin, TX.*
