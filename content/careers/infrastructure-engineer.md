## Full Job Description

We are looking for a savvy and seasoned devops/sysadmin here in Austin to work alongside the founders. The successful recruit will work hand in glove with the CTO and anchor a growing technical team. The upside potential is extremely large for the right candidate in terms of both cash compensation and equity. This is no mere job. It requires a founder's caring and curious mentality, and a burning desire to ship code to shape the future of decentralized finance.

Our product is Vertalo, a blockchain-based cap table critical to the future of digital investment. Think of a traditional cap table reimagined for the emerging tokenized asset sector (meaning soon, all private assets). Our focus on digital assets and secondary liquidity sets us apart from larger incumbents. All this equates to a huge market and huge growth potential for our team. There are extensive near-term opportunities and longer-term exit scenarios for our company.

*This is not a remote position. You will be required to work out of our offices here in Austin, TX.*

*You will be focusing primarily on infrastructure and devops, rapidly deploying product that appeals to our market, then figuring out how to scale it.*

### About you:
- High school diploma or equivalent
- Authorized to work in the U.S.
- 3+ years experience in UNIX sysadmin (including heavy shell scripting)
- 3+ years experience with devops on AWS (including CloudFront, Lambda, EC2, S3 and other services)
- 2+ years experience with Terraform
- Experience with FreeBSD Ports, Poudriere, configinit a strong plus
- **Ambitious** - you are looking specifically for a startup opportunity and the chance to hit it big
- **Self-starting** - you're OK with some ambiguity and pushing until you figure things out
- **Great at quickly making it work** - we iterate fast and you need to be able to keep up
- **Comfortable at an early-stage startup** - startup life isn't for everybody... make sure it's right for you
- **Hungry** - you're a missionary, not a mercenary
