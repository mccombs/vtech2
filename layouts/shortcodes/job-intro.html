We are looking for a savvy and seasoned {{ .Inner }} here in Austin to work
alongside the founders. The successful recruit will work hand in glove with
the CTO and on a growing technical team. The upside potential is extremely
large for the right candidate in terms of both cash compensation and equity.
This is no mere job. It requires a founder's caring and curious mentality, and
a burning desire to ship code to shape the future of decentralized finance.
